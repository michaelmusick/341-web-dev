# Week 4 - More with HTML

This week, we will spend the week almost exclusively learning about additional HTML elements. 

We will start with more structural markup elements, specifically, various types of lists. Lists are something that are used constantly in communicating information and HTML has very logical ways for working with lists. 

Next, we will look at a lot of semantic markup elements that are used to add or change the meaning of text and prose. 

Finally, we will look at how to use links for other websites, as well as e-mailing, and images.
